Higgs mechanism represents a profound breakthrough in comprehending how particles acquire mass. At its core lies the ethereal Higgs firld, which permeates the entirety of space. Symmatry has always been a guiding principle in physics, and what makes the Higgs mechanism captivating is its involvement in the breaking of a specific symmetry.

According to the thoery, during the initial moments after the Big Bang, particles were devoid of mass, and all forces were unified. However, as the universe cooled and underwent a phase transition, the Higgs field emerged, spontaneously breaking the symmetry and giving birth to the diverse masses of particles observed today.

The Higgs mechanism further predicts the existence of the Higgs boson, a particle that corresponds to the Higgs field. In a landmark achievement, the Higgs boson was eventually discovered in experiments conducted by ATLAS and CMS collaborations ar CERN in 2012. 

This momentous detection confirmed the presence of the Higgs field and validated the theoretical framwork proposed several decades earlier. This discovery have profound implecations for our comprehension of the universe. Not only have they provided a crucial puzzle piece in particle physics, but they have also shed light on the origins of mass and the underlying symmetries that shape our universe.
