A theory is said to exhibit symmetry under a group $G$ if, when we apply transformations using the members of $G$, the fundamental compoenents or entities of the theory remain unchanged, and the Lagrangian, which describes the system's dynamics, remains invariant. 

In physics there are two types of symmetries:

**Global Symmetry:** meaning that it remains unchanged under a transformation of the form $e^{i\theta}$, where $\theta$ is a constant but arbitrary phase. Global symmetries are associated with conserved quantities and can be explained using Noether's theorem
$$
\psi'(x) = U_\theta \psi(x) = e^{-i\theta}\psi(x)
$$
where $\theta$ is constant in all spacetime. If the phase $\theta$ of the fermion field is not observable, then the Lagrangian is invariant under global transformation. It's obvious that the transformation is unitary and abelian. This transformation is denoted as $U(1)$ 

**Local Symmetry:** On the other hand, a theory can have a gauge symmetry, which asserts that the mathematical description of a physical theory should remain unchanged under specific transformations known as gauge transofrmations. There transformations are local, meaning they can vary from point to point in spacetime.

$$
\psi'(x) = e^{-i\theta(x)}\psi(x)
$$
Gauge invariance holds immense significance in modern physics, as it serves as a foundational principle underlying our understanding of the fundamental forces and particles that govern the universe.

This principle plays a crucial role in the development of gauge theoriesm, such as quantum electrodynamics, quantum chromodynammics, and the electroweak theory.

Gauge invariance imposes constraints on the behavior of physical fields, requiring them to transform in a specific manner under these gauge transformations to maintain the invariance of the theory.

Gauge invariance ensures the consistency and self conservation of Gauge Theories, where gauge fields mediate the interactions between particles and carry the corresponding forces. It (gauge invariance) does it by governing the behavior of the particles and fields involved.

The Higgs mechanism, intimately connected to gauge invariance plays a critical role in electroweak theory by spontaneously breaking symmetry and providing masses to the $W$ and $Z$ bosons while preserving gauge invariance.
