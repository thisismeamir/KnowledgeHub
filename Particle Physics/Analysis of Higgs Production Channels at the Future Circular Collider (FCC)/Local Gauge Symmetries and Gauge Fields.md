It is obvious that the three forces are disconnected from each other (at lower energy levels). Proposed by Howard Georgi and Sheldon L. Glashow, it is a possibility that in very high energies these forces (or more specifically their corresponding coupling contants) would converge toward a single, unified force (value). This would mean that all elementray particles and forces are just different manifestations of that force.

A significant breakthrough in this possibility was when Glashow, Weinberg and Salam successfulle merged the weak and electromagnetic interactions. A crucial realization in this pursuit was that all fundamental interactions remain unchanged under local gauge transformations. 

Because of this there's a hope that gauge theories will serve as the foundation for comprehensive unification of all fundamental interactions, representing a notable step in that direction.

The standard model of particle physics encompasses three distinct quantum gauge theories that elucidate the electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions among elementary particles. These theories are renormalizable, meaning they can be mathematically adjusted to account for infinites and yield meaningful results. 

The $U(1)$ gauge theory, also known as quantum electrodynamics (QED), described the electromagnetic force. It is based on the $U(1)$ symmetry group, where "$U$" stands for unitary and $1$ denotes a one-dimensional representation.

The $SU(2)$ gauge theory is a key component of electroweak theory, which unifies the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forcecs. It is based on the $SU(2)$ symmetry group, where $S$ denotes special unitary and $2$ represent a two-dimensional representation.

Nature exhibits symmetries, some of which are precise, while others are only rough approximations. For instance, the earth can be modeled as a perfect sphere for various purposes sice it has rotational symmetry. Nevertheless, we are aware of the deviations that only matter when we need to consider the Earth's gravitational potential has a leading monopole term that represents its spherical symmetry, but there are also smaller dipole and quadrupole terms that indicate the breakdown of rotational symmetry.
